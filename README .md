# Adding Files to Git Repositories

This repository contains an HTML file that describes the steps to add files to Git repositories. Below are the steps summarized:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository:** Use `git init` to start a new repository.
2. **Add Files:** Use `git add .` to add files to the staging area.
3. **Commit Changes:** Use `git commit -m "Your message"` to save changes to the repository.
4. **Connect to Remote:** Use `git remote add origin <repository URL>` to link to a remote repository.
5. **Push Changes:** Use `git push origin master` to push changes to the remote repository.

    To push your local repository to GitHub, follow these steps:

1.   **Create a Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Note the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`).

2. **Add GitHub Repository as a Remote:**
   - In your local Git repository, add the GitHub repository as a remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
     ```

3. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Push your local repository to GitHub by executing:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```
   - This command pushes the changes in your local `master` branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

4. **Enter GitHub Credentials:**
   - If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

5. **Verify the Push:**
   - Check your GitHub repository to ensure that the local changes have been successfully pushed.

Key Points:
- `origin` is the conventional name for the remote repository but can be changed to any meaningful name.
- It's recommended to use SSH URLs for more secure authentication and easier pushing/pulling.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to push to the GitHub repository.
